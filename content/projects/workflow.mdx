design is not simply a matter of presenting product information. it needs some principles like sound design, storytelling, VFX, marketing principles, user research, design patterns, personas, agile UX, design thinking, Apple/Google guidelines, and design sprints to some extent.


## 🤝brainstorming

**key questions**

1. what is my goal in sharing my design?
2. who is my target group?
3. on which platform can I best reach this target group?
4. how can I optimally use my design on this platform?

**here are a few goals you might pursue with our design:**

- do you want to increase brand awareness?
- attract new customers?
- begin engaging with your audience?
- show how using your product can help solve a problem?


## 📋 script

1. hook: grasp the attention (first 3-5 secs)
2. benefits: why they should care the product (majority)
3. cta: gets users to the shopping site or profile/website. (last few secs)
