## üìä research

we conducted user research based on the company's past advertisements and social media engagements.

from our analysis, we determined the key features we wanted advertisement to have.

the key¬†**takeaways**:

- users wanted a more¬†**aesthetically**¬†pleasing ad.
- they wanted the advertisement to be¬†**shorter**, with less¬†**distractions**¬†when displaying products.
- we need to feel them¬†**exclusive.**

we took a deeper look at where the majority of the company's audience from.

throughout our explorations in those locations we were looking for the following:

- someone who is well-respected in those regions.
- eg: leaders, artists, scientists, cult pioneers that respected by people there.


## ‚ö° strategy

we synthesized the research that we obtained from the website data in the form of a **advertisement strategy** same as the biggest company in the world, apple.

what apple does so well;

- create the feeling of limited edition, "special", and luxury supply without the supply actually being limited.
- this way they obviously keep supply high, and if they play their cards right the demand high too. this makes you infinitely more money than any other strategy.

but how does apple create this?

``they associate with rarity``

apple's think different (1997) campaign.

their first popular advert (as linked above) was based around "greatness and exclusiveness" and showed a bunch of top-performing people.


essentially associating themselves with rarity, the top 0.0001% without the product being rare, or top 0.0001% in terms of supply.

## üó∫Ô∏è roadmap

**key question:** how can we increase viewer contentment and show them the products they seek subconsciously?

we did a similar strategy when which products to advertise. we compiled the user databases such as gender, location, age-range from the company databases. we picked the artworks of famous people who are ranked the top as popularity according to google search and analytics in these locations.

we picked the artworks that associated with the most-searched famous people in particular countries where the company retains the most active users.
